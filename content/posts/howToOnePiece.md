## Where do I start for One Piece TCG?

I think there are a few easy ways to start. 

## What's the best booster box to buy? / Are booster boxes worth it?

The short answer is no, boosters and packs are theoretically not worth it financially worth it. However, if you want to buy booster and packs do it.

I have bought a lot of boosters since I live near a Bandai Store (we will talk about this later); but, this is purely for my own pleasure (and maybe gambling addition) not to try to make money or anything.

## What about starter decks?

Official starter decks can be good but won't be competitive without changes. I can think of a handful of starter decks that released (ST15-20) that all had pretty big affects on the metagame.

My roommate only played starter decks when we played against each other and it was pretty even especially at the start and we were both learning. It's low commitment as most start decks are only 11.99 and you can just start playing. While at the time of writing this the 2 cheapest decks in the top 10 are $30-$45 each.

## What accessories do I need?

If you already are familiar with TCG please skip this because you might disagree with me. 

At the barest minimum you need a playmat and your cards.

### Card Sleeves
I recommend getting card sleeves. Both Dragon Shields and Katana make good matte back card sleeves.

Standard Size (not Japanese)

Personally I use Dragon Shields. Why? No clue, they just were one of the two recommended and I got them. Both Dragon Shields and Katana are good.

Optionally you can get inner sleeves called Perfect Fits. Most people don't do this, I do. My deck is way thicker than most people because of it. I put on Perfect Fits then put on Dragon Shields over that, alternating the opening so that dust can't get in. I've not met many people who do this. I did meet someone for the first time who triple sleeved!

There are also outer sleeves, most people don't triple, but I've seen more people use normal sleeves with outer sleeves. So they are still double sleeving but using outers instead. Sometimes it makes your cards not fix in the deck box you might get so just we aware if you use outers and already have a deck box.

Also shout out to that one dude who triple sleeved all his cards. 

### Leader Card Sleeves
If you buy an Alt Art for your leaders a lot of people put them in Ultra Pro Mini Snap Card Holder, Clear.
They are the same size as most card sleeves and are hard plastic. They also fit really well in your deck box.

Since you don't need to shuffle the leader, you can easily get away with it.

### Playmats

I bought a few playmats that were official products. They are good, you can literally use any playmat you want. I've seen a lot of people use playmats from Etsy. Playmats are a way you can express yourself, people will also notice if you have a super degenerate one. Some like it some don't. I'm not sure if I've seen anyone being kicked out of a tournament, so if you are someone who wants a degenerate playmat maybe get a feel for your local scene before splurging. 

### Deck boxes

I don't know too much about these I just buy from Ultimate Guard (who are the people who make Katana Sleeves). I like them. Sidewinders fit in their big Omnihive so I like it.

For Ultimate Guard, my double sleeved cards need the size 100 to fit with the leader and dons as well. So 61 cards fits in the 100. I like to buy the 133 size because I have extra cards and might want to change stuff out.

You can also buy Magic Commander Deck Boxes. I don't have them but I've seen people with them.

### Dice?
Some people like dice for 2 reasons.
To decide who goes first or use it to count the change in power or cost for certain decks.

### Card Storage
Most people agree you only need penny sleeves. Ultra Pro are what most people use for standard penny sleeves.

### Bulk Storage
I have no many many people who do bulk. So it's really my own context. You have 2 options Cardboard or Plastic.

Cardboard is cheaper. Most stores I see that have card bulk just put common cards in Trading Card Storage Box.

Or you could spend more and get the BCW 6 Drawer Card Catalog - Black

We are talking like a 5x cost to get it in Plastic instead of Cardboard. Really up to you how you want to do it.

## Bulk?

I got a lot of bulk for free recently. I was at the Bandai Store when they restocked. Some people bought 4 Booster Boxes, opened, took the good stuff and asked if anyone wanted bulk. I took it since no one else wanted it.

It's pretty easy to get bulk if you are lucky. People hate bulk.
